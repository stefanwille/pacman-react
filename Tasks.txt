- Ghosts general behaviour:
  - At each tile they choose a new target tile to go toward.
  - Then they inspect all neighbour tiles
  - A tile that is in opposite direction is removed.
  - Tiles in a wall are removed.
  - From the remaining moves, the distance to the target is calculated. The closest one is chosen as the next tile.
  - If there are multiple tiles with the same distance, the tiles are prioritized. Up is highest.

- When the ghost reaches a position that would make it stand still, choose the first free direction that is not backward instead.
- Show ghost states
- After 7 seconds, go to hunt mode. After another 20 seconds, go to back to scatter mode
- Let GamePage have controls to show waypoints
- Fix revivePacMan
- Enable ghosts to leave the Box. This requires them to move between tiles. Probably a new state is required
- Implement individual ghosts behaviours in hunt mode:
  - Blinky: PacMan
  - Pinky: The tile 4 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 4 tiles up and 4 tiles to the left.
  - Inky:
    o An intermediate tile is chosen. It is 2 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 2 tiles up and 2 tiles to the left.
    o Then the vector from the intermediate tile to Blinky is rotated 180 degrees. This is inkys target tile.
  - Clyde:
    o When >= 8 tiles away from pacMan: Target is PacMan.
    o When < 8 tiles away: Same tile as in scatter mode.


- When entering chase mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- When entering scatter mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees

- Frightened Mode:
  - Ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
  - Ghosts show Frightened sprite
  - In each tile they choose a random direction that is not backward and not into a wall


- Red targets Pacman
- pinky (rosa) targets 4 tiles ahead of pacmans current position
- inky (green)
