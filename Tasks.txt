- 😘Extract makeGhosts
- 😘Try to remove GameInterface
- 😘Refactor store so that it doesnt get in the way
- 😘Make scatter mode work
  - 😘Warum geht der Ghost nicht von 1/7 nach 1/8?
  - 😘Warum geht der Ghost nach -1/28 statt bei 1/1 stehen zu bleiben?
  - 😘Warum geht die Anzeige kaputt?
  - Have different scatter goals per ghost
- 😘Prevent ghost from going backwards, buy excluding the back direction in the wayfinding frontier
- 😘Break up the CSS into many files
- 😘Add tailwind to remove hacks
- 😘useLocaleStore instead of useMemo
- 😘Make the game display cleanly on a MacBook
- 😘Have a backref from PacMan to Game to access timestamp
- 😘Extract Game.pills into Maze store
- 😘Fix the missing ways at 7/14 and 8/14
- 😘Turn AnimationTestPage into a GamePage that plays the game
- 😘Let the ghosts start in scatter mode
- 😘Implement individual ghosts behaviours in scatter mode
- 😘Ghosts general behaviour:
  - 😘At each tile they choose a new target tile to go toward.
  - 😘Then they inspect all neighbour tiles
  - 😘A tile that is in opposite direction is removed.
  - 😘Tiles in a wall are removed.
  - 😘From the remaining moves, the distance to the target is calculated. The closest one is chosen as the next tile.
  - 😘If there are multiple tiles with the same distance, the tiles are prioritized. Up is highest.
  - 😘Then the new direction is chosen towards the new tile
- 😘When the ghost reaches a position that would make it stand still, choose the first free direction that is not backward instead.
- 😘Make ghost#wayPoints a @computed value - dependent on tileCoordinates and targetTile
- 😘Fix chooseNextTile() / Found no candidate
- 😘Support tunnel
- 😘SShow ghost targets
- 😘Implement individual ghosts behaviours in hunt mode:
  - 😘Blinky: PacMan
  - 😘Pinky: The tile 4 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 4 tiles up and 4 tiles to the left.
  - 😘Inky:
    o 😘An intermediate tile is chosen. It is 2 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 2 tiles up and 2 tiles to the left.
    o 😘Then the vector from the intermediate tile to Blinky is rotated 180 degrees. This is inkys target tile.
  - 😘Clyde:
    o 😘When >= 8 tiles away from pacMan: Target is PacMan.
    o 😘When < 8 tiles away: Same tile as in scatter mode.
- 😘After 7 seconds, go to hunt mode. After another 20 seconds, go to back to scatter mode
- 😘Enable ghosts to through the tunnel
- 😘findNextTile: Always use waypoints[1] as the next tile instead of searching through waypoints
- 😘Let ghosts move slower in tunnel
- 😘Remove ghost.timestamp
- 😘When entering chase mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- 😘When entering scatter mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- When pac man dies
   - 😘let all ghosts pause
   - 😘wait 5 seconds
   - When pac man has some live left
      - 😘revive pac man
      - 😘reset the ghosts
   - 😘 When pac man lost all lives
      - 😘Hide the ghosts and pac man and show "Game Over"
- 😘 Separate SCREEN_TILE_SIZE and SPRITE_TILE_SIZE.
- 😘 When I go to the bottom directly after start, the maze moves around on the screen. Probably because of the target sprite outside the maze.
  - 😘 Debug approach:
    - 😘 in Game constructor, place pac man and ghosts at the bottom
    - 😘 Add a pause key
  - 😘 Idea to fix:
    - 😘 Have a container for all sprites (= Board)
    - 😘 Set it to overflow: none
- 😘 Switch Ant to v4
- 😘 Have ghost state view
- 😘Ghosts that kills pac man enters scatter mode many times, over and over This is most visible in game over, when this happens forever.
- Frightened Mode:
  - 😘 Detect collions with energizers
    - 😘 Increase score
    - 😘 Remove energizer
  - When Pac man eats an energizer
      - 😘 Ghosts enter frightened state
      - 😘 Pac Man enters chasing state
      - 😘 the Frightened timer gets reset to 0
      - 😘 game.killed ghost counter get reset to 0

    - on collision a ghost dies
      - 😘 its state becomes "dead"
      - 😘 dead ghost counter increments
      - 😘 score increases 100, 200, 400, 800
      - 😘 The ghost shows the "eyes" sprite
      - 😘 No collision detection with a dead ghost
      - 😘 Can I use a broken number as target for the ghost? To guide it back to the house? And out of the house? It would be 13.5/11

😘 Bug: After a ghost died, it ignores walls and just always moves in the same direction.
  - 😘 The problem seems to be that the ghost never meets a tile center. This is problem a consequence of the frightened ghost moving at half speed.... A solution would be change speed only at a tile center.
😘 Bug: After a ghost died, the energizer timer gets reset to 0. That's not supposed to happen.
  - Dead ghosts:
    - 😘 Go to the box
    - 😘 Why can't they pass into the box anymore?
      - 😘 Write a test
    - 😘 Write timer: TimeoutTimer
- 😘 Move Score to the top
- 😘 Change extra live direction

- 😘 Add GameDebugView with Restart Game
- 😘 Move Revive PacMan to PacManDebugView

  - 😘 in Pacmans chasing state
    - when the energizer timer exceeds the chasing time,
      - 😘 Pac man goes back to eating mode
      - 😘 Alive Ghosts go to scatter state
  - in frightened state Ghosts
    - 😘 They show a frightened sprite
    - 😘 They move slowly
    - 😘 In each tile they choose a random direction that is not backward and not into a wall
    - 😘 When late in the frightened phase, they show the "late frightened" sprite
    - 😘 During the last 2 seconds of being frightened they show a white and blue blinking sprite
    - 😘 Fix bug where ghost in tunnel doesnt follow its target tile. Seems to happen also when pacman hits one of the ghosts. With all ghosts.
- 😘 Support notebook screen - make debug view smaller

- 😘 Don't pause ghosts on pac mans death
- 😘 Run Tests on git push
- 😘 Margin on the Game Page
- 😘 Score for killing ghosts
- 😘 Add margin for app
- 😘 Extract model directory
- 😘 Move Page specific components to page directory
- 😘 Bug: Switching between pages multiplies game speed
- 😘 Clean up onTimeElapsed
- 😘 Extract PacMan.moveBy
- 😘 Remove setter actions from Store
- 😘 Bug: Switching between pages doesn't reset the game
- 😘 Hide debug panel if screen is not wide enough, because the game doesn't really work with the panel
below the maze.
- 😘 UI based tests

- Viewport for mobile.
  Alternative: Always render at factor 1 and then apply a transform, based on current viewport width

- Touch based game play for mobile
